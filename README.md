## Favorite Activities

### Snowboarding
  - Snowboarding is easily my favroite activity, I usually go at least twice a week while in season! My family all does winter sports and we own a condo at Holiday Valley. I skied for five years and this  will be my ninth year snowboarding!
  
### Soccer
  - Soccer was always a passion of mine, ever since I was young I remember playing soccer. I played throughout my entire childhood and I can say I met most of my friends because of the sport. We still play on a team we made called the Amherst Amateurs :joy:
  
### Concerts
   - Concerts bring a sense of excitement to everyone participating and thats why I love going. UB's concert this semester was crazy with Lil Yachty, D.R.A.M, Rae Sremmurd and Travis Scott. Other concerts I went to this summer was TWENTY ØNE PILØTS, G-Eazy and Logic, Blink-182 and I just went to Kerfuffle Before Christmas a few weeks ago!
